# FishE - Quizzes & Flashcards
FishE is an easy-to-use quizzes and flashcards app built with Java Swing:
- utilizes ArrayList to extract content from a .txt file, which includes quiz titles and questions
- users can choose the duration and number of questions for each game
- the flashcards mode enables users to review all the questions within a selected topic.

The how-to-go-through-the-questions idea is based on the Code Bro YouTube tutorial, which inspired me to make the whole app ;)

## Main objectives: <img align="right" img src="https://github.com/annov723/FishE/blob/master/quiz-game/mini.png" width=250>
- designing a user-friendly interface by adding selfmade graphicsa and editing all interactive elements
- implementing a scrollbar
- utilizing a .txt file (dat.txt) to dynamically modify the number of quizzes, their titles and associated questions -> this way we can easily upload more and more quizzes to the app :)
